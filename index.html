    <h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>My name is <span style="color:green">Maxwell Vetter</span>. This is my first public website, made for my Web Design class. </p>
    <p>I'm a student at Mount Saint Joseph University, where I'm majoring in Application Development with a Creative Writing minor. I'm also involved in a 3 + 3 program that'll lead to me studying law in my later college years.</p>
    <p>My dream job would be to work in the field of Video Game Design, as a designer, developer or even director. I love learning about storytelling, literature, language and different entertainment mediums - I was the president of my high school's Dungeons and Dragons club, in addition to being a Japanese club officer and having taken the language for 5 years.</p>
